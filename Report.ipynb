    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I am currently using my COVID-19 imposed quarantine to expand my deep learning skills by completing the [*Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree*](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). This past week I have been working my way through the seminal 2015 *Nature* paper from researchers at [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/) [*Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) (Minh et al 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Minh et al 2015 important?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Minh et al 2015 was not the first paper to use neural networks to approximate the action-value function, this paper was the first to demonstrate that the same neural network architecture could be trained in a computationally efficient manner to \"solve\" a large number or different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also contributed several practical \"tricks\" for getting deep neural networks to consistently converge during training. This was a non-trivial contribution as issues with training convergence had plaugued previous attempts to use neural networks as function approximators in reinforcement learning tasks and were blocking widespread adoption of deep learning techniques within the reinforcemnt learning community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Minh et al 2015 uses deep (convolutional) neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q^*(s, a) = \\max_{\\pi} \\mathbb{E}\\Bigg[\\sum_{s=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^s r_{t+s} | s_t=s, a_t=a, \\pi \\Bigg] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the maximum sum of rewards $r_t$ discounted by $\\gamma$ at each time-step $t$ achievable by a behaviour policy $\\pi = P(a|s)$, after making an observation of the state $s$ and taking an action $a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to this seminal paper it was well known that standard reinforcement learning algorithms were unstable or even diverged when a non-linear function approximators such as a neural networks were used to represent the action-value function $Q$. Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Minh et al 2015 discuss several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlations present in the sequence of observations of the state $s$. In reinforcement learning applications the sequence state observations is a time-series which will almost surely be auto-correlated. But surely this would also be true of any application of deep neural networks to model time series data. \n",
    "2. Small updates to $Q$ may significantly change the policy, $\\pi$ and therefore change the data distribution.\n",
    "3. Correlations between the action-values, $Q$, and the target values $r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper the authors address these issues by using...\n",
    "\n",
    "* a biologically inspired mechanism they refer to as *experience replay* that randomizes over the data which removes correlations in the sequence of observations of the state $s$ and smoothes over changes in the data distribution (issues 1 and 2 above).\n",
    "* an iterative update rule that adjusts the action-values, $Q$, towards target values, $Q'$ that are only periodically updated thereby reducing correlations with the target (issue 3 above)."

    "### Approximating the action-value function, $Q(s,a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possible ways of approximating the action-value function $Q$ using a neural network. The only input to the DQN architecture is the state representation and the output layer has a separate output for each possible action. The output units correspond to the predicted $Q$-values of the individual actions for the input state. A representaion of the DQN architecture from the paper is reproduced in the figure below. "

    "\n",
    "The hyperparameter $\\beta \\ge 0$ controls how strongly to correct for the bias: $\\beta=0$ implies \n",
    "no correction; $\\beta=1$ fully compensates for the bias. For stability reasons, since these \n",
